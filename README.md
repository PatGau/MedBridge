#MedBridge

Medbridge is a sophisticated online platform that facilitates seamless communication between healthcare professionals and their patients. Our platform boasts an innovative feature that enables patients to schedule appointments with a doctor with a single click. However, to access this feature, patients must register by providing their medical details, which we ensure are kept confidential and secure to protect user privacy.

Furthermore, our platform guarantees that patient medical records are only accessible to doctors until the diagnosis is complete. Once the treatment is over, doctors' access to patient records is terminated, but the records remain available to the patients at all times.

Additionally, we have implemented a location-based feature that allows patients to access information about nearby doctors and filter the results based on location.

To ensure that our platform is free from misuse, we have implemented comprehensive authentication measures. We have developed the platform using the cutting-edge Flutter technology for user interface design and Firebase for the backend and data storage.
